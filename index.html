<p><center>Welcome to my DH1001 Portfolio. In it you will find my responses to the discussion questions asked in class.</center></p>

<h2>Responses to Anatomy of an AI System</h2>
<p><blockquote>I found this article to be very eye opening into the methods and practices behind ai systems like the amazon echo and Alexa. Before reading this i had no idea of the true extent of what goes into creating and running these ai systems and how harmful this can be to both the Earth and ourselves. I found it fascinating how the ways in which a simple question being asked to one of these systems has hidden behind it an incredibly large cost of operation both in the exploitation of human labour and the extraction of valuable materials from the Earth itself. Going through your average day you would'nt think of the these costs. I think we are too used to the convenience of this technology in our everyday lives. There are so many ways that the small but powerful and wealthy group at the top exploit people and their consumers. I think this is a major issue but it has been for a very long time. This article expresses the issue of class division and how negative the impacts are. How oblivious most of us are to this issue.</blockquote></p>

<h2>Responses to The Internet's Own Boy </h2>
<p><blockquote>Before watching this documentary i had never heard of Aaron Swartz and everything he accomplished in giving all of us access to an open internet. I never really thought too deeply about what efforts it took by people like Aaron to give us access and the freedom of use of information that we have today and that we take for granted. The greed of companies mentioned like JSTOR was unimaginable. Aarons unselfishness was incredibly important to our online freedoms today. His unwillingness to bow down under a broken and corrupt system should be celebrated by everyone who uses the internet. People like him are important in pushing the needle and helping to improve things. I found it frustrating but not surprising the lengths that the government and people in power went to try and stop him. Its incredibly unfortunate and unjust that the people in power that only wanted to keep control of that power pushed him in the direction that he went. </blockquote></p>

<h2>Social Media and the Web - Principles within "a contract for the web."</h2>
<p><blockquote>The points Eli Pariser makes in his TED talk were and still are incredibly important for a fair, free and accessible web.  Even though the talk was released in 2011 we unfortunately still encounter the same systems and algorithms that are embedded in search engines and social media. Arguably it has become worse since then. With the more singular ownership over multiple social media platforms like Meta has with Facebook, Whatsapp etc... and Twitter being bought by Elon Musk there's more of a chance of people finding themselves lost in filter bubbles.<br><br>

Both principle's 5 and 8 should be fundamental pillars of a free and accessible web. I believe that they go hand in hand with one another. A strong community should be built on trust and respect by both other users and companies. Our data is now a commodity that can be taken and sold when there should be a clear and accessible way of knowing what information you're giving up and who can access it. This lack of trust is a major issue between the user and large companies.<br><br>

Principle 8 is lifted up with the help of principle 5. Trust is important for everyone to feel more safe online. Like the point mentioned in Pariser's talk there is a problem with accessibility and availability of the internet for some groups. There should be equal access to something that has become such an important tool in the modern day. To prevent access and availability to the internet is to cut someone off from a global online community.</blockquote></p>

<h2>Response to - should all archives be Open Access?</h2>
<p><blockquote>Rev's article brings up a lot of interesting points for both sides of the argument. From issues with having the full context of a document due to redactions of important figures to sensitive data being leaked because of too many places online holding information for hackers to easily access. I think its a difficult argument to choose a side for. To me it feels like there needs to be a middle ground with what information is able to be open access. I lean more to believing that archives should be open access but with respect to peoples privacy that want it protected. I know that would be difficult to determine for everyone mentioned. There are issues today online with companies taking absorbent amounts of data. With the rise of AI it will most likely be even more difficult to protect their private data. There are advantages and disadvantages to both, open access giving more people access to information, broader historical context, known government actions vs privacy/ safety concerns and censorship</blockquote></p>

<h2> Where might the Internet of Sounds go from here?</h2>
<p><blockquote>After this introduction to the IoT and IoS I think that we'll only see more and more integration into every day life. Even today a lot of things have embedded systems in them that you might not think have them. The video in the introduction slides about work place tracking and everything practically being on rails weirded me out a bit. That to me is a sort of obvious sign of the negative and dystopian side of these things. Its used today by amazon having complaints that its too restrictive. Unfortunately i see that kind of system being used more in the future. It's interesting how people are using IoT and IoS for preserving things. I hope that we get to see more examples like the Adria Rattle.  I hope we see even better methods used to preserve things and make them accessible to more people. AI looks like its going to play more of a role into the future.</blockquote></p>

<h2>Read / watch one of the items and respond below ...</h2>
<p><blockquote>I decided to read the Guardian article about the inventor of the first chatbot, Joseph Weizenbaum. After reading through the article i found it interesting that the first chatbot Eliza and modern day ChatGPT etc. are very similar to each other. Eliza was designed to emit an illusion of understanding so that it could 'pass' as a real person, similar to the chatbots we have today. But what exactly is ai? It was mentioned in the article how Eliza was designed with a set of rules to be able to return a plausible response and that something like ChatGPT is a large language model designed to mathematically predict what to say next. Both models essentially follow the same idea of having their own set of rules to determine an outcome. Essentially designed to trick the person using it into believing there is a kind of thought process rather than just information grabbing based on prediction.<br><br>

The definition of intelligence from Oxford Languages is "The ability to acquire and apply knowledge and skills". I think that ai is intelligent in a different way to our definition or, at least, has certain aspects of the definition. AI has the ability to acquire knowledge from every corner of the internet and apply it to a response of a prompt given to it but doesn't have the ability to think, reason or truly understand what its being asked to do. It does things automatically when prompted. It doesn't truly think or analyze but but predicts. Mentioned in the article was what Weizenbaum said about "intelligence existing as a whole person, not just any one part" and that "intelligence isn't in the head but also the arm, wrist, hand." I think that ai today isn't truly/fully intelligent as it lacks some of the most important fundamental aspects of intelligence. Towards the end of the article Weizenbaum spoke about ai being capable of calculation but not judgement. A really interesting and i think important point was brought up about the idea that even if ai can do a task/ job, it shouldn't be allowed to do certain jobs like acting as a  judge or a therapist. For as far as ai has come in the modern day i don't think it is 'actually intelligent' </blockquote></p>
